Group Project For Finals, Group: Christian, Tanner, Hunter
(only invoices table works like how we want it to, same type of code for the other vehicle table but it just doesnt wanna work, 
but here in our group, we are proud of invoices table... 
all hail its glory and succumb to its wraith 
as it takes over the whole extent of the human races 
and puts its dominance over the docket classroom.

  "Invoice Table, You are good."
  
  "We still did the best we could..."
  
  "Visual Studio kind of sucks."
  
  "It should really self-destruct..."
  
  "Invoice Table, You are good."
  
  "We still did the best we could..."
